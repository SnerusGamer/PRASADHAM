#Rpart is a powerful machine learning library in R that is used for building classification and regression trees.
#Caret is a pretty powerful machine learning library in R. With flexibility as its main feature, caret enables you to train different types of algorithms using a simple train function.
#Rattle is a popular free and open source Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the R software, one that focuses on beginners looking to point-and-click their way through data mining tasks.
